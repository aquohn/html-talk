Initial setup: `npm install`.

For fully offline use, install fonts:
 - On Mac, with homebrew:
   - `brew tap caskroom/fonts`
   - `brew cask install font-open-sans font-montserrat`

You might be able to just have the web fonts cached or something, though, I don't know.

To build the files (rebuilding on change) and run a webserver: `serve.sh`.
