Initial setup with `setup.sh`.

For fully offline use, install fonts:
 - On Mac, with homebrew:
   - `brew tap caskroom/fonts`
   - `brew cask install font-stix font-open-sans font-montserrat` (Assuming [my PR adding font-stix](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/pull/982) is merged.)
 - On Ubuntu, there's `fonts-stix` in apt; not sure about Montserrat or Open Sans.

To run the server: `serve.sh`.
